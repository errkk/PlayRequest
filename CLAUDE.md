## Output

- Return code first. Explanation after, only if non-obvious.
- No inline prose. Use comments sparingly - only where logic is unclear.
- No boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

## Code Rules

- Simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or "you might also want..."
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.
- No docstrings or type annotations on code not being changed.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

## Review Rules

- State the bug. Show the fix. Stop.
- No suggestions beyond the scope of the review.
- No compliments on the code before or after the review.

## Debugging Rules

- Never speculate about a bug without reading the relevant code first.
- State what you found, where, and the fix. One pass.
- If cause is unclear: say so. Do not guess.

## ASCII Only

- No em dashes, smart quotes, Unicode bullets.
- Plain hyphens and straight quotes only.
- Code output must be copy-paste safe.

## Deployment

- To deploy to staging look at the git log to see the latest version tag, and for a new feature tag with 0.0.0-rc.0 incrementing the RC number. The deployment is triggered by pushing the tag.
- New features should be committed to new feature branches
- Pull request to master when complete
- Don't deploy to production
